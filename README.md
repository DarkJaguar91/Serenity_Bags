#Serenity_Bags
##Wildstar bag replacement addon:

###Details:
Serenity_Bags is an addon to replace the standard bag addon.<br />
It organises the items in your bag into seperated bag windows according to the Family Name given to the item by the wildstar developers.<br />
It also shows the bag in a new more understandable way with no hidden windows etc.

###ChangeLog:

####As of 02/06/2014:
* Changed the salvage menu system (Salvage an item by pressing: CTRL + Middle Mouse Button)
* Added a feature that allows you to set items to a Family name you choose: ALT + Middle Mouse Button on an item opens otions to create your own Bag Name for the chosen item. If you already have your own bag names, they will appear in a auto complete window to the right (click a name and it will auto type into the edit box)
* Efficiency corrections

* Correctly marks items as seen when closed now
* Efficiency corrections

####As of 31/05/2014:
